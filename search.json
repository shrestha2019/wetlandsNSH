    "text": "The Nebraska Sandhills\nThere are approximately 3.7 million acres of wetlands in the Nebraska Sandhills, which comprise the largest dune field in the Western Hemisphere (LaGrange et al. 2005). Sandhills wetlands range in size from less than one acre to 2300 acres. The wetlands are vulnerable to extensive change in land use by drainage and climate effect."

The National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, using aerial images of varying, provides the fundmental assessment of wetlands and its type throughout coterminous U.S. However, NWI only provides snapshot of wetlands that are dynamic and therefore do not represent intra- or inter-annual variation.\nAdvancement in satellite sensors and algoriithms helps us to assess the dynamic wetlands at multiple spatial and temporal dimensions."

We use Sentinel-2, Landsat, and MODIS (Aqua and Terra) sensors to assess wetlands dynamics at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Our mesic vegetation (MVP) approach is applicable in wide geography and is robust, rapid, repeatable, replicable. A detail in method is found in MVP."

    "text": "Status of Wetlands in the Nebraska Sandhills​\n\nWetland persistence maps\nA wetland persistence map (left) is special type of map that illustrates the frequency at which wetlands varies in extent during a given period of time. Wetlands that are highly consistent over time, and where vegetation is present throughout the growing season, appear bluish on the map. In contrast, intermittent wetlands appear reddish. A graphical representation of selected Hydrologic Unite Codes (HUC) shows seasonal and inter annual dynamic (below). The plot directly below illustrates annual wetland dynamics documented by two satellites MODIS and Sentinel-2.\n\n\n\nTemporal patterns\nMODIS at 500 m resolution provides daily observation while Sentinel-2 at 10-20 m resolution revisits every 5-10 days enabling wetland at multiple scales.\n\nLandsat satellite data provide a historical perspective. For example, the selected HUC shows increasing trend in wetland occurrence since 1984-2024.​\n\nThe sustainable management of our wetlands is greatly enhanced by an improved understanding of intra-inter annual wetland dynamics.​"
