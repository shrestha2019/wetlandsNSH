Sandhills wetlands range in size from less than one acre to 2300 acres. The wetlands are vulnerable to extensive change in land use by drainage and climate effect.",

The National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, using aerial images of varying, provides the fundmental assessment of wetlands and its type throughout coterminous U.S. However, NWI only provides snapshot of wetlands that are dynamic and therefore do not represent intra- or inter-annual variation.\nAdvancement in satellite sensors and algoriithms helps us to assess the dynamic wetlands at multiple spatial and temporal dimensions.",

We use Sentinel-2, Landsat, and MODIS (Aqua and Terra) sensors to assess wetlands dynamics at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Our mesic vegetation (MVP) approach is applicable in wide geography and is robust, rapid, repeatable, replicable. A detail in method is found in MVP.",

    "text": "Status of Wetlands in the Nebraska Sandhills​\n\nWetland persistence maps\nA wetland persistence map is special type of map that illustrates the frequency at which wetlands varies in extent during a given period of time. Wetlands that are highly consistent over time, and where vegetation is present throughout the growing season, appear bluish on the map. In contrast, intermittent wetlands appear reddish. The figure below shows the persistence of wetlands in the Nebraska Sandhills derived using MODIS Aqua and Terra images between 2000 to 2024 at 500 m spatial resolution.\n\n\n\nTemporal patterns\nA graphical representation shows seasonal and inter annual dynamic of wetlands. The plot below illustrates wetland dynamics documented by two satellites MODIS and Sentinel-2 at multiple spatial and temporal scales. The plot directly below inllustrates the seasonal and annual dynamics at the selected Hydrologic Unit Codes (HUC) using MODIS using daily observation while Sentinel-2 at 10-20 m resolution revisits every 5-10 days enabling wetland dynamics at multiple scales.\n\nLandsat satellite data, with 30 m spatial and 16 day revisit period, provide a historical perspective. For example, the selected HUC shows increasing trend in wetland occurrence since 1984-2024.​\n\nThe sustainable management of our wetlands is greatly enhanced by an improved understanding of intra-inter annual wetland dynamics.​",

    "text": "This website provides information on measuring wetland dynamics in the Nebraska Sandhills using remote sensing. The wetlands are mapped using mesic vegetation persistence (MVP) approach developed by Shrestha et. al., (2024). (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170491). MVP uses a combination of moisture change index (MCI) and modified chlorophyll absorption ration vegetation index (MCARI2) to classify mesic vegetation from upland dry vegetation. Mesic vegetation includes mesic habitats, e.g., wetlands, riparian zones, and wet meadows but excludes open water.\nThe approach provides spatial and temporal dynamics of mesic vegetation using time series of Landsat, Sentinel-2, and MODIS sensors. The approach is rapid, repeatable, and reproducible at wide geography encompassing arid and semi-arid regions.",
